# CoronaCTScan

Here I tried classification if a patient suffers from COVID or not based on CT Scanned images obtained from Kaggle.
NOTE: This classification is incorrect. Apparently the data images I downloaded from the datasets of kaggle were wrong.
There are noticably many images of covid in the negative folder as well. The only waaaay I could get this running is by over-fitting.
The model had to eventually byheart the images!!
